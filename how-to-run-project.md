To run the project from the GitHub repository Indigo-Invest/simple-react-socket-io, follow these steps:

🧰 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (preferably version 14 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)

📁 Project Structure
The repository is organized into two main directories:

server: Contains the Node.js backend using Express and Socket.IO.

react-client: Contains the React frontend application.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository

bash

git clone https://github.com/Indigo-Invest/simple-react-socket-io.git
cd simple-react-socket-io

Install Server Dependencies

Navigate to the server directory and install dependencies:

bash

cd server
npm install

Start the Server

Start the backend server:

bash

node index.js
The server should start on port 9013.

Install Client Dependencies

Open a new terminal window, navigate to the react-client directory, and install dependencies:

bash

cd react-client
npm install

Start the React Application

Start the frontend application:

bash

npm start

The React app should open in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.

🚀 Testing the Application
With both the server and client running:

Open multiple browser tabs or windows at http://localhost:3000.

Interact with the application to see real-time communication facilitated by Socket.IO.

🛠️ Troubleshooting
Port Conflicts: Ensure that ports 9013 (server) and 3000 (client) are not in use by other applications.

CORS Issues: If you encounter Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) errors, consider using the cors middleware in your Express server:

javascript

const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
Socket.IO Connection: Verify that the client is correctly connecting to the server. In the React application, the connection is established as follows:

javascript

socket.current = io("ws://localhost:9013");
Ensure that the URL matches your server's address and port.
